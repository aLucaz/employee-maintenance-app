# Employee Maintenance App

This is a minimalistic application designed to streamline the management of essential employee information within an organization. 
<br/>With a primary focus on simplicity and efficiency, this MVP offers the following key features:

1. **View Employee Information**: Quickly access and display fundamental details about employees, including their names, job titles, contact information, and hire dates. This feature provides an at-a-glance overview of the workforce.

2. **Edit Employee Details**: Easily update critical employee information, such as their department and employment status. This functionality allows administrators or authorized personnel 
to make necessary adjustments in real-time.

Designed as a Minimum Viable Product (MVP), this application provides essential functionality to support basic employee management needs. 
<br/>It simplifies the process of viewing and editing employee data while maintaining a user-friendly interface.

For more advanced features and expanded capabilities, future iterations of the Employee Maintenance App can be developed based on specific organizational requirements.
